1. The Program should be imported to Java Running applications, and can be runned.
The Test inputs and the training data inputs are hardcoded in the program.

2. The Training sets can be changed with initializing the inputIN variable with different training data.

3. The Graph will be automatically generated when the java program runs.

4. The Network structure can be changed as follows:
Node: To change number of nodes, increasing the iteration value of Hidden layer loop declaration will suffice.
Layer: To increase the number of layers, adding for loops similar to existing Layer declartion will work.
